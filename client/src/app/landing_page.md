#Landing Page planning document
This document is ONLY for building the pathing between webpages

all pages should automatically be set to background color: 5A9F68
The whole website should have a pastel feel to it

4 navigable pages from landing page: 
Home -> back to landing page
Graph -> page with an editable interactive Bar graph, multiple selectors on data to display.
News -> news coorelated with legislation
Search -> this button takes you to a page with a querry box that lets you type and search


landing page components

- navigation bar component
Location:
- This component exists at the top of the landing page as an offwhite colored strip,
Buttons: 
- The navBar has 6 rounded rectangle buttons on it with a hover effect that lights them up. The buttons should display the names Home, Graph, News, and Search
- onClick these buttons should take you to the 4 naviagable pages specified above, but the nav bar should remain in the exact same place ie. it should be its own component that is persistant across all 5 webpages.
- each of these pages should have its own file in @src/app
